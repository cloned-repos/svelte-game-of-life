- create buttons:
  - `nextstep`: compute next step in conway rule
  - `seed`: seed the grid

  - `execute command queue`
  - `plot the results of executing the command queue`
  - pretty print debug info in chrome devtools console, 
    - but think about making nice command console like in intelliJ
